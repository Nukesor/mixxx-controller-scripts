# Custom Mixxx scripts

This repo contains my custom script for my "Traktor Kontrol S2 MK3" DJ controller.

Changed things:

- Only a single effect is active at a time.
  Pressing a different FX button, disables all other active FX units.
- The FX knob that usually only controlls the high/low pass filter, now controls the currently active FX.
- The left button below the `Browse` knob switches between the directory and track view.
